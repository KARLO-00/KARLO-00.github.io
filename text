Color Pallete

#0a0a0a (dark base)

#4a6fa5 (blue accent)

#d1d5db (soft sage)

#ffffff (highlight)

Color Roles (Very Important)

Don’t use colors freely — assign roles.

Recommended usage

Background: #0a0a0a

Primary text: #ffffff

Secondary text: #d1d5bb

Accent / links / highlights: #4a6fa5

⚠️ Never use all four in one component.

2️⃣ Improve Contrast (Subtle but Critical)

Pure white on pure black can feel harsh.

Fix:

Use #ffffff only for:

Name

Headings

Use #d1d5bb for:

Paragraphs

Meta text

Tech stacks

Result: more elegant, less eye strain.

3️⃣ Signature Accent Usage (Your Identity)

Use #4a6fa5 sparingly but consistently.

Best places:

Section title underline

Active nav indicator

Link hover

Small arrows →

Never:

Big backgrounds

Large blocks

Body text

This keeps it premium.

4️⃣ Subtle Layering Using Sage Tint

Use #d1d5bb as a ghost layer, not a surface.

Examples:

Divider lines at opacity: 0.25

Project meta text

Status indicators

Avoid full cards with it — it’s too soft and kills contrast.

PROJECTS
––––––––
• Project title (white)
  Short description (sage)
  PHP • JS • SQL (sage, small)
  → View project (blue on hover)

Hover & Focus States (Design Detail)

Make interactions feel intentional.

Example:

Link normal: white

Hover:

underline grows

color shifts to #4a6fa5

arrow slides 4px

Minimal motion, maximum polish.

7️⃣ Navigation Design Using Your Palette

Default nav text: #d1d5bb

Active link:

white text

thin left bar in #4a6fa5

Hover:

text becomes white

underline in blue

8️⃣ One Optional “Standout” Element

Pick one place to slightly break the rules.

Good choices:

Your name partially in #4a6fa5

A thin vertical line in blue beside hero

A single section title in uppercase + blue underline

This becomes memorable without noise.

9️⃣ Design Consistency Rules (Follow These)

Max 2 colors per section

Accent color appears once per viewport

White is earned, not default
